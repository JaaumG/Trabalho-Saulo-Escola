## School managing system made in C
This is a project from college where we build a manage system to work like a database only in C.
In this system you are able to manage the teachers, students, class, or grades, with relations between them, every student has a grade in class, every class has its own teacher, and every teacher and student has its own adress.

## High Scale text at the start
Using the code i write previously, the
[Title-Generator](https://github.com/JaaumG/Title-Generator) is able to generate text in a 5x5 size letter, by running for loops its able to write the letter on a matrix of the same size, on this project i just edit the code so its works like a function.
